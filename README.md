Tank Wars

Project Overview:
Tank Wars is a Java-based two player online multiplayer game designed to facilitate physics-based tank combat between two players. Players will each control a tank on a destructible two-dimensional map and must reduce the enemy playerâ€™s tank to 0 hit points. The game will use Java Swing for its graphical interface and interactive features to create interesting gameplay for the user. 

Features: 
Turn-Based Online Multiplayer: Two players will be able to play each other through an online connection and will have a timer to make their turn.
Physics-Based Combat: Players will be able to control the trajectory and speed of projectiles that they shoot at each other.
Weapon Selection: Players will have access to different types of projectiles that they can shoot at each other depending on situation, i.e. explosive, boring, cluster rounds
Destructible Terrain: Explosive rounds will break the environment and change the map.
Interactive Game Elements: There will be collectible power ups that can enhance movement, weapons or restore hit points.
Movement: Players will be able to move their tank left and right across the screen to better reposition themselves and collect power ups.

Technologies:
Java Swing: Game GUI
Computer Networking: Allow for online multiplayer connection
Multithreading: To optimize real-time interactions and gameplay mechanics
UI/UX: Intuitive controls for peak user experience.
